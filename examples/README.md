# Examples

To build the examples, run `gulp bundle`. The resulting Javascript files can be found
in the `/build` directory.

To run an example that can be run at the console, try `gulp Module`. For instance,
to run the `Examples.Time.FPS` example, try `gulp Examples.Time.FPS`. Or, of course,
you can just run `node build/Examples/Time/FPS.js` if you like.
