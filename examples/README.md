# Examples

To build the examples, run `gulp bundle`. The resulting Javascript files can be found
in the `/build` directory.

To run an example, try `gulp Module`. For instance, to run the
`Examples.Time.FPS` example, try `gulp Examples.Time.FPS`. If the example can
be run under Node, it will do that. If not, a web page will be opened with the
example in it.
